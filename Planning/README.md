For this project, we are creating the game Tsuro.
Tsuro is a board game for three to five players. To play, players compete to have the last playing piece remaining on the board. Player turns consist of placing tiles on the board from the playerâ€™s hand. Then they move their respective pieces along these paths. Players are eliminated by following a path that ends at the board edge.

Design plan is in plan.md.
